# Theory :
# Data Type 
*A DATA TYPE, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error*

## Types :
- Primitive Data Type 
    - int
    - float
    - char  
    - bool
    - double
    - void
    - wide character

- Non-Primitive Data Type
    - Derived Data Type
        - Array
        - Pointer
        - Function 
        - Reference
    - User-Defined Data Type 
        - Class
        - Structure
        - Union
        - Enum
        - Typedef

# Data Modifers 
A modifier is used to alter the meaning of the base type so that it more precisely fits the needs of various situations. 

## Types : 
- signed 
- unsigned
- long
- short

## What's Done ? 
    We will make a program to output the sizes of various Primitive data type and wil notice the effect of data modifiers.
